# PasswordChanger
Browser add-on that helps change your passwords to some addictive social medias for a chosen amount of time.

As of now, this project is in break. There is no planned date to continue working on it.
It was started as part of a learning experience for a cybersecurity company owned by my father.

The only things developped up until this point are a a function to copy a string to the clipboard and a function that creates a random password given 5 criteria:
length, includes lowercase, includes uppercase, includes digits and includes symbols.
